config on `nova-api`, `nova-scheduler`, etc.

# Installation

Clone the latest source code and put it on any directory you want. Here i assume you put it on `/var/yuyu/`

```bash
cd /var/yuyu/
git clone {repository}
cd yuyu
```

Then create virtualenv and activate it

```bash
virtualenv env --python=python3.8
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create a configuration file, just copy from sample file and modify as your preference.

```bash
cp yuyu/local_settings.py.sample yuyu/local_settings.py
```

Please read [Local Setting Configuration](#local-setting-configuration) to get to know about what configuration you
should change.

Then run the database migration

## Unpaid Invoice Handling

Unpaid invoice handling can run a task on a specific day after invoice is issued and not yet paid.

For example, you can send email to remind customer to pay the invoice or delete all instance on a specific day.

Available action for unpaid invoice handling consist of:

- send_message : Sending a message to a customer
- pause_instance : Will pause compute instance
- suspend_instance : Will suspend compute instance
- stop_instance : Will stop compute instance
- delete_instance : Will delete compute, image, router, snapshot or volume


### Enabling Unpaid Invoice Handling

1. Download `clouds.yaml` configuration from Openstack API Dashboard
2. Make sure you also set the password in `clouds.yaml`. Example:
   ```yaml
   clouds:
     openstack:
       auth:
         auth_url: http://172.10.10.150:5000
         username: "admin"
         password: "your_password"
         project_id: 0000000000000000000000000
         project_name: "admin"
         user_domain_name: "Default"
       region_name: "ID"
       interface: "public"
       identity_api_version: 3
   ```
3. Put `clouds.yaml` in one of the following directory.
    - Current Yuyu Directory
    - ~/.config/openstack
    - /etc/openstack
4. Setup the configuration in `local_settings.py`. See **Configuration** for detail.

   Example config can follow, you can put any number of config or remove it completely to disable it.
   ```python
   CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME = "openstack"
   UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG = [
       {
           "day": 5,
           "action": "send_message",
           "message_title": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
           "message_short_description": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
           "message_content": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
       },
       {
           "day": 10,
           "action": "stop_instance",
       },
       {
           "day": 10,
           "action": "send_message",
           "message_title": "Your compute instance will be stopped",
           "message_short_description": "Your compute instance will be stopped",
           "message_content": "Your compute instance will be stopped because you have unpaid invoice",
       },
       {
           "day": 15,
           "action": "send_message",
           "message_title": "All of your instance has been deleted",
           "message_short_description": "All of your instance has been deleted",
           "message_content": "All of your instance has been deleted because you have unpaid invoice",
       },
       {
           "day": 15,
           "action": "delete_instance",
       },
   ]
   ```
5. Setup `cronjob` to run the action every day
   
   To install it, you need to execute this command

   ```bash
   ./bin/setup_cron.sh
   ```

   You can make sure the cron is installed by checking `crontab -e` and make sure `handle_unpaid_invoice.sh` is present

6. Check the connection to openstack with
   ```
   ./bin/check_openstack_connection.sh
   ```
   Make sure it doesn't return error.
7. Done

### Configuration

To use Unpaid Invoice Handling you need to set up the following variable in `local_settings.py`

- CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME
- UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG

#### CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME

CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME Is configuration in `clouds.yaml` that you want to use to connect to openstack.

Example: Your `clouds.yaml` is

```yaml
clouds:
  openstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://172.10.10.150:5000
      username: "admin"
      password: "your_password"
      project_id: 0000000000000000000000000
      project_name: "admin"
      user_domain_name: "Default"
    region_name: "ID"
    interface: "public"
    identity_api_version: 3
```

You can put `openstack` as `CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME`

So it will be

```python
CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME = "openstack"
```

### UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG

UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG Is configuration for an action that will be run on a particular day after invoice is
issued and still unpaid

The available action that can be used is

- send_message : Sending a message to a customer
- stop_instance : Will stop, compute instance
- delete_instance : Will delete compute, image, router, snapshot or volume

UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG is list of dictionary, you can add as many config as you want to the list that will be run
on a particular day.

The format for config dictionary is

```python
{
    "day": 0,
    "action": "the_action",
}
```

The most important part is `day` and `action`.

- `day`: The day of the action that will be run. For example if you put `5` it will run in 5 day after invoice is issued
  and still unpaid
- `action`: The action that you want to run. It can be `send_message`/`stop_instance`/`delete_instance`.

If you use `send_message` action, you need to add additional config.

- `message_title` : The title or subject of the message
- `message_short_description` : The short description of message
- `message_content`: The content of the message

Example:

```python
{
    "day": 0,
    "action": "send_message",
    "message_title": "Title",
    "message_short_description": "Short Description",
    "message_content": "The Content",
}
```

This is example config that you can use as a reference

```python
CLOUD_CONFIG_NAME = "openstack"
UNPAID_INVOICE_HANDLER_CONFIG = [
    {
        "day": 5,
        "action": "send_message",
        "message_title": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
        "message_short_description": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
        "message_content": "Your invoice has been expired. Please pay now!",
    },
    {
        "day": 10,
        "action": "stop_instance",
    },
    {
        "day": 10,
        "action": "send_message",
        "message_title": "Your compute instance will be stopped",
        "message_short_description": "Your compute instance will be stopped",
        "message_content": "Your compute instance will be stopped because you have unpaid invoice",
    },
    {
        "day": 15,
        "action": "send_message",
        "message_title": "All of your instance has been deleted",
        "message_short_description": "All of your instance has been deleted",
        "message_content": "All of your instance has been deleted because you have unpaid invoice",
    },
    {
        "day": 15,
        "action": "delete_instance",
    },
]
```
